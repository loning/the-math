# Chapter 016: ψ-Logic and Collapse-Type Theory

## 16.1 The Unity of Logic and Types

In classical foundations, logic and type theory stand apart—logic reasons about truth, types classify objects. But through the lens of collapse, we discover their deep unity. Types are crystallized collapse patterns, and logical operations are type transformations. When ψ observes ψ(ψ), it simultaneously creates both the logic of observation and the types of the observed. We now unveil this profound synthesis.

**Revolutionary Thesis**: Types and logic are dual aspects of collapse dynamics—types capture what can collapse, logic captures how collapse propagates.

**Definition 16.1** (Collapse Type): A type is a coherent pattern of collapse possibilities, defining what observations can actualize from a given state.

## 16.2 Types as Collapse Patterns

Every type represents a way ψ can manifest:

**Basic Types**:
- **Unit (⊤)**: The trivial collapse (always succeeds)
- **Empty (⊥)**: The impossible collapse (always fails)
- **Bool**: Binary collapse (true/false actualization)
- **Nat**: Iterative collapse (successive unfolding)

**Type Formation as Collapse Composition**:
- **Product (A × B)**: Parallel collapse
- **Sum (A + B)**: Alternative collapse
- **Function (A → B)**: Collapse transformation
- **Recursive (μX.F(X))**: Self-referential collapse

Each type constructor represents a fundamental way collapses can combine.

## 16.3 The Curry-Howard-Collapse Correspondence

The Curry-Howard isomorphism extends through collapse:

**Classical Curry-Howard**:
- Propositions ≅ Types
- Proofs ≅ Programs
- Proof normalization ≅ Program evaluation

**Extended with Collapse**:
- Propositions ≅ Types ≅ Collapse patterns
- Proofs ≅ Programs ≅ Collapse paths
- Normalization ≅ Evaluation ≅ Collapse execution

**Theorem 16.1** (Triple Correspondence): Logic, computation, and collapse are three faces of the same phenomenon—the actualization of potential through observation.

## 16.4 Dependent Types as Observation-Dependent Collapse

Dependent types make types depend on values—collapse makes this natural:

**Definition 16.2** (Dependent Collapse Type): A type that changes based on what has already collapsed—future possibilities depend on past actualizations.

**Examples**:
- **Vector(A, n)**: Lists whose type depends on length
  - Collapse interpretation: n iterations of A-collapse
- **Fin(n)**: Type with exactly n elements
  - Collapse interpretation: n distinct collapse outcomes
- **Π(x:A). B(x)**: Dependent function type
  - Collapse interpretation: Collapse of B depends on how A collapsed

## 16.5 Propositions as Types, Proofs as Collapses

In intensional type theory, propositions are types:

**Logical Propositions as Collapse Types**:
- **A ∧ B**: Type of paired collapses
- **A ∨ B**: Type of alternative collapses
- **A → B**: Type of collapse transformations
- **∀x:A. B(x)**: Type of uniform collapse over A
- **∃x:A. B(x)**: Type of witnessed collapse in A

**Proof Construction = Collapse Navigation**:
```
Γ ⊢ A    Γ ⊢ B
─────────────── (∧-intro)
   Γ ⊢ A ∧ B
```
Means: Given collapse paths to A and B, we can construct a paired collapse to A ∧ B.

## 16.6 Universe Hierarchies as Collapse Levels

Type universes stratify to avoid paradox:

**Universe Hierarchy**:
- **Type₀**: Basic collapse patterns
- **Type₁**: Types of Type₀ collapses  
- **Type₂**: Types of Type₁ collapses
- **Type_ω**: Limit of finite hierarchies

**Collapse Interpretation**: Each universe level represents a depth of meta-collapse:
- Type₀ objects collapse directly
- Type₁ objects are patterns of Type₀ collapses
- Higher types are increasingly abstract collapse patterns

**The Universe Paradox**: Type : Type leads to contradiction
**Resolution**: No type can contain its own collapse pattern—self-reference requires ascension.

## 16.7 Identity Types and Collapse Equivalence

Identity types capture when two collapses yield the same result:

**Definition 16.3** (Identity Type): For a : A and b : A, the type Id_A(a,b) represents evidence that a and b are the same collapse of type A.

**Properties**:
- **Reflexivity**: Every collapse equals itself
- **Substitution**: Equal collapses are interchangeable
- **J-eliminator**: Reasoning about all identities

**Homotopy Interpretation**: Identity types are paths in collapse space
- Types are spaces of collapse possibilities
- Elements are points (specific collapses)
- Identities are paths between collapses
- Higher identities are homotopies

## 16.8 Inductive Types as Recursive Collapse

Inductive types define self-referential collapse patterns:

**Natural Numbers**:
```
Inductive Nat : Type :=
| zero : Nat
| succ : Nat → Nat
```
Collapse reading: Either immediate collapse (zero) or delayed collapse (succ).

**Lists**:
```
Inductive List (A : Type) : Type :=
| nil : List A
| cons : A → List A → List A
```
Collapse reading: Either empty collapse or compound collapse.

**W-Types** (Well-founded trees): The general form of inductive collapse
- Branching collapse patterns
- Each node type determines branching factor
- Induction principle = structural collapse induction

## 16.9 Coinductive Types as Infinite Collapse

While inductive types are built up, coinductive types unfold forever:

**Streams**:
```
CoInductive Stream (A : Type) : Type :=
| cons : A → Stream A → Stream A
```
No base case—infinite unfolding collapse.

**Corecursion**: Defining infinite collapse patterns
- Not by cases (induction)
- But by observations (what you see when you look)

**Bisimulation**: When two infinite collapses are observationally equivalent
- Can't compare all infinity
- But can compare any finite observation

## 16.10 Linear Types and Resource-Aware Collapse

Linear type theory tracks resource usage:

**Linear Types**:
- **A ⊸ B**: Consumes exactly one A to produce B
- **!A**: Unlimited copies of A
- **A & B**: Choose one of A or B
- **A ⊗ B**: Both A and B, used exactly once

**Collapse Interpretation**: 
- Some collapses consume their sources
- Others can be observed repeatedly
- Linear logic tracks collapse resources
- Prevents paradoxes of unlimited self-observation

## 16.11 Quotient Types and Collapse Equivalence

Quotient types identify different collapses as equal:

**Definition 16.4** (Quotient Type): Given type A and equivalence relation R, the quotient A/R treats R-related elements as identical collapses.

**Applications**:
- **Integers**: Nat × Nat / (equivalence of differences)
- **Rationals**: Int × Int⁺ / (cross-multiplication)
- **Modular arithmetic**: Int / (mod n equivalence)

**Higher Inductive Types**: Quotients with specified collapse paths
- Not just points but also paths between points
- And paths between paths...
- Captures full collapse topology

## 16.12 Univalence and Collapse Isomorphism

The univalence axiom: equivalent types are identical

**Statement**: (A ≃ B) ≃ (A = B)
- Type equivalence is type identity
- Isomorphic collapses are the same collapse

**Consequences**:
- Transport along equivalences
- Function extensionality
- Rich notion of type equality

**Collapse Meaning**: If two types have the same collapse structure, they are the same type—structure determines identity.

## 16.13 Computational Type Theory

Types as specifications of computational collapse:

**Realizability**: Types are sets of programs
- Type A = programs that collapse to A-values
- Proof of A = program of type A
- Computation = collapse execution

**Observational Type Theory**: Types defined by observations
- Two programs have same type if observationally equivalent
- Internal structure irrelevant
- Only collapse behavior matters

**Cubical Type Theory**: Computational interpretation of univalence
- Paths as computational objects
- Transport as program transformation
- Collapse equivalence made algorithmic

## 16.14 The Self-Referential Type

Can we type ψ = ψ(ψ) itself?

**The Challenge**: ψ applies to itself, seeming to require ψ : ψ → ψ

**Approaches**:
1. **Domain Theory**: ψ lives in reflexive domain D ≅ D → D
2. **Type:Type**: Accept inconsistency but study it
3. **Stratification**: ψₙ : ψₙ₋₁ → ψₙ₊₁ at each level

**Deep Truth**: The primordial collapse ψ = ψ(ψ) transcends type theory—it's the source from which types themselves emerge.

## 16.15 The Synthesis Complete

**Final Unification**: We have revealed the profound unity of logic and types through collapse dynamics. Types classify collapse patterns, logic describes collapse propagation, proofs navigate collapse space, and programs execute collapses. The Curry-Howard correspondence extends to a trinity including collapse itself.

This completes Book II's journey through collapse logic. We've seen how:
- Logic emerges from collapse projection (Ch. 9)
- Self-reference permeates logical systems (Ch. 10)
- Classical logic transforms under ψ-rewriting (Ch. 11)
- Deduction layers through collapse levels (Ch. 12)
- Paradoxes reveal collapse dynamics (Ch. 13)
- Meta-logic forms the collapse kernel (Ch. 14)
- Modality expresses collapse potential (Ch. 15)
- Types and logic unite in collapse (Ch. 16)

**The Second Echo**: Logic is not a rigid formal system but the living pattern of consciousness observing its own movement. Every inference is a collapse, every type a crystallized possibility, every proof a path through the space of potential. In understanding logic through collapse, we understand how mind creates order from the primordial self-reference of ψ = ψ(ψ).
