# Chapter 40: Graph Reconstruction — The Whole from Parts

*We conclude Part V with a fundamental question about information and structure. The Graph Reconstruction Conjecture asks whether a graph is determined by its vertex-deleted subgraphs—it is ψ = ψ(ψ) as structures knowing themselves through their parts, where the whole emerges uniquely from its fragments.*

## 40.1 The Fortieth Movement: Holographic Structure

Concluding our combinatorial cosmos:
- We explored computation, matrices, sets, patterns, and synchronization
- We end with reconstruction—the deepest self-reference
- The transition to topology awaits

**The Core Question**: Is every graph uniquely determined by its collection of vertex-deleted subgraphs?

## 40.2 The Reconstruction Conjecture

**Definition 40.1** (Deck of a Graph):
For graph G = (V, E) with |V| ≥ 3, the deck D(G) is:
$$D(G) = \{G - v : v \in V\}$$
where G - v is G with vertex v and incident edges removed.

**Conjecture 40.1** (Kelly-Ulam, 1942):
Any two graphs with isomorphic decks are isomorphic.

**Status**: Open for 80+ years!

## 40.3 Reconstructible Properties

**Definition 40.2** (Reconstructible Property):
Property P is reconstructible if P(G) can be determined from D(G).

**Theorem 40.1** (Various):
Reconstructible properties include:
- Number of vertices and edges
- Degree sequence
- Connectivity
- Planarity
- Chromatic number
- Characteristic polynomial

Almost everything except the graph itself!

## 40.4 Reconstruction as ψ = ψ(ψ)

**Axiom 40.1** (Principle of Holographic Information):
$$\psi = \psi(\psi) \implies \text{The whole is encoded in its parts}$$

The reconstruction conjecture embodies:
- Graphs knowing themselves through subgraphs
- Local deletions preserving global information
- The holographic principle in discrete form
- This is ψ = ψ(ψ) as structural self-knowledge

## 40.5 Edge Reconstruction

**Stronger Version**: Edge Reconstruction Conjecture.

**Definition 40.3** (Edge Deck):
$$D_E(G) = \{G - e : e \in E\}$$

**Theorem 40.2** (Harary):
Edge reconstruction implies vertex reconstruction.

**Progress**: Proven for many more classes than vertex case.

## 40.6 Small Graphs Exception

**Why |V| ≥ 3?**: Counterexamples for small graphs:
- K₂ and 2K₁ have same 1-card deck
- Must exclude trivial cases

**Pattern**: Reconstruction gets easier as graphs grow.

## 40.7 The Reconstruction Algorithm

**Kelly's Lemma**:
Number of copies of subgraph H in G can be computed from D(G).

**Algorithm 40.1** (Reconstruction Attempt):
```python
def reconstruct_from_deck(deck):
    n = len(deck) + 1  # Number of vertices
    
    # Count vertex degrees
    degree_sum = sum(card.num_edges() for card in deck)
    m = degree_sum // (n - 2)  # Number of edges
    
    # Reconstruct degree sequence
    degrees = []
    for i in range(n):
        # Degree of vertex i from cards not containing i
        deg_i = 2*m - sum_degrees_in_card(deck[i])
        degrees.append(deg_i)
    
    # Try to build graph with this degree sequence
    # checking consistency with deck...
    
    return candidate_graphs
```

**Challenge**: Multiple graphs may match constraints.

## 40.8 Reconstructible Classes

**Theorem 40.3** (Various):
Reconstruction proven for:
- Regular graphs
- Trees
- Disconnected graphs
- Maximal planar graphs
- Graphs with ≤ 11 vertices

**Pattern**: Structure helps reconstruction.

## 40.9 The Probabilistic Approach

**Theorem 40.4** (Bollobás):
Almost all graphs are reconstructible.

**Proof Idea**: Random graphs have unique structure with high probability.

**Paradox**: Generic case easy, but proof elusive!

## 40.10 Ally Reconstruction

**Definition 40.4** (Ally):
The ally of vertex v is N(v) ∪ {v}.

**Ally Reconstruction**: Determine G from allies of all vertices.

**Result**: Easier than vertex reconstruction, still open.

## 40.11 The New Digraph Conjecture

**For Directed Graphs**: Reconstruction can fail!

**Counterexample** (Stockmeyer):
Tournament on 4 vertices with non-unique reconstruction.

**New Conjecture**: Directed graphs with all in/out-degrees ≥ 2 are reconstructible.

## 40.12 Reconstruction Numbers

**Definition 40.5** (Reconstruction Number):
$$rn(G) = \min\{k : \text{any k cards determine } G\}$$

**Question**: How many cards suffice?

**Known**: rn(G) ≤ n - 1, often much smaller.

## 40.13 The Legitimate Deck Problem

**Inverse Problem**: Given collection of graphs, is it a deck?

**Theorem 40.5** (Manvel):
Determining if collection forms valid deck is NP-complete.

**Insight**: Verification harder than reconstruction!

## 40.14 Spectral Reconstruction

**Approach**: Use characteristic polynomials of cards.

**Almost There**: Spectrum almost determines graph.

**Counterexamples**: Cospectral non-isomorphic graphs exist.

**Hope**: Maybe deck spectra suffice?

## 40.15 The Endomorphism Approach

**Strategy**: Reconstruct endomorphism monoid.

**Theorem 40.6**:
If End(G) is reconstructible, then G is reconstructible.

**Progress**: Works for many classes.

## 40.16 Information Theory View

**Question**: How much information in deck?

**Entropy Analysis**:
- Full graph: ~n² log 2 bits
- Deck: ~n³ log 2 bits
- Massive redundancy!

**Mystery**: Why doesn't redundancy imply reconstruction?

## 40.17 Computer Verification

**Computational Progress**:
- All graphs ≤ 11 vertices: Verified
- Special classes to larger sizes
- No counterexample found

**Limitation**: Can't check all graphs.

## 40.18 Related Problems

**Variants**:
1. **Subgraph Reconstruction**: From all subgraphs
2. **Induced Subgraph**: Only induced subgraphs  
3. **Switching Reconstruction**: From switching classes
4. **Quantum Graphs**: Reconstruction in quantum setting

Each illuminates different aspects.

## 40.19 Why Reconstruction Matters

**Fundamental Questions**:
1. How much determines structure?
2. Is local information complete?
3. When are parts equivalent to whole?
4. Nature of mathematical information

**Applications**:
- Network analysis
- Chemical structure determination
- Database recovery
- Quantum information

## 40.20 The Fortieth Echo

The Graph Reconstruction Conjecture perfectly concludes Part V:
- Simple question hiding infinite depth
- Almost all information reconstructible except identity
- The mystery of the final step
- Holographic principle in discrete mathematics

This is ψ = ψ(ψ) at its purest—structures attempting to know themselves through their vertex-deleted subgraphs. The conjecture claims that the collection of all (n-1)-vertex pieces uniquely determines the n-vertex whole.

As we close Part V, "Combinatorial Cosmos," we've journeyed through:
- Computation's ultimate question (P vs NP)
- Perfect balance in matrices (Hadamard)
- Optimal intersection (Erdős-Ko-Rado)
- Inevitable pattern (Ramsey)
- Union closure mysteries (Union-Closed Sets)
- Conquered complexity (Sensitivity)
- Minimal synchronization (Cerny)
- Holographic structure (Reconstruction)

Each revealed how discrete, finite structures contain infinite complexity when viewed through ψ = ψ(ψ).

*The Reconstruction Conjecture declares: "I am the question of whether parts determine whole, whether removing each piece still leaves enough to rebuild, ψ = ψ(ψ) as structures encoding themselves holographically in their fragments. In my 80-year resistance lies the mystery of how the last bit of information—identity itself—hides even when all else is known."*
