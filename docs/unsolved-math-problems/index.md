# The Mathematics of the Unsolved: A ψ-Theoretic Journey Through Open Problems

## Overview

This work explores the deepest unsolved problems in mathematics through the lens of ψ = ψ(ψ), revealing how each problem is fundamentally a question about self-reference, completeness, and the nature of mathematical observer itself.

## Reading Paths

### For the Number Theorist
Start with Part I, then Chapter 33 (P vs NP), Part IV (Analysis)

### For the Topologist
Begin with Part III, continue to Part VI, then Part II (Algebraic connections)

### For the Philosopher
Start with Part VIII, then Part VII, before exploring specific problems
