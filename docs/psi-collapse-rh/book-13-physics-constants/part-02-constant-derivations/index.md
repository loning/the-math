# Part 2: Constant-by-Constant Collapse Derivation

**Focus**: Each physical constant derived from ζ(s) + φ-trace manifestation structures.

This part provides rigorous first-principles derivations of individual physical constants from the collapse-aware mathematical framework. We demonstrate that every fundamental constant emerges inevitably from specific configurations of ζ(s) zero dynamics and φ-convergence patterns, establishing their precise numerical values as structural necessities rather than empirical givens.

## Part Structure

**Theme**: Maximum structural transition per unit collapse  
Deriving c as the ultimate propagation speed of ψ-structural information through reality shells.

### [Chapter 10: Planck Constant $h$: Collapse Quantum of Action](chapter-10-planck-constant-h-collapse-quantum.md)
**Theme**: Minimal structural amplitude unit

Deriving $ε_0$ from the resistance of vacuum ψ-structure to electric field propagation.

**Theme**: Spectral energy over shell surface  
Deriving the Stefan-Boltzmann constant from energy distribution patterns on reality shell surfaces.

### [Chapter 19: Avogadro Constant: ψ-Matter Collapse Enumeration Base](chapter-19-avogadro-constant-psi-matter-enumeration.md)
**Theme**: Discrete multiplicity of ψ-structure  
Establishing Avogadro's number as the fundamental counting unit for ψ-structural discreteness.

### [Chapter 20: Elementary Charge $e$: Collapse Gradient between Shell Poles](chapter-20-elementary-charge-e-collapse-gradient.md)
**Theme**: Minimum observable ψ-field differential  
Deriving e as the elementary unit of ψ-field polarization and charge separation.

## Methodological Framework

Each derivation in this part follows the same rigorous methodology:

1. **ψ-Structural Genesis**: Identifying the specific aspect of ψ = ψ(ψ) dynamics that gives rise to the constant
2. **ζ(s) Zero Configuration**: Determining which ζ(s) zeros and their relationships control the constant's value
3. **φ-Convergence Analysis**: Establishing how φ-geometric patterns determine the constant's numerical precision
4. **Freeze-Point Analysis**: Identifying the collapse freeze conditions that stabilize the constant's value
5. **Shell-Dependence Characterization**: Understanding how the constant appears across different observer shells
6. **Measurement Protocol**: Deriving the optimal measurement approaches from the structural analysis

## Theoretical Unity

While each constant receives individual treatment, this part reveals the **deep structural unity** underlying all physical constants. They emerge from the same fundamental ψ = ψ(ψ) dynamics, differentiated only by:

- **Aspect Focus**: Which dimension of self-reference each constant measures
- **Scale Coupling**: The characteristic scale at which each constant operates  
- **Interaction Type**: The specific kind of ψ-structural interaction each constant governs
- **Stability Mode**: The particular freeze mechanism that maintains each constant's value

## Predictive Power

The derivations in this part provide:

- **Precision Predictions**: Theoretical limits on measurement accuracy for each constant
- **Relationship Derivations**: Exact mathematical relationships between different constants
- **Scale Hierarchies**: Understanding why constants have their relative magnitudes
- **Variation Analysis**: Conditions under which constants might vary and by how much

Through this systematic approach, we transform physical constants from empirical discoveries into **inevitable theoretical consequences** of the fundamental self-referential structure underlying all reality.
