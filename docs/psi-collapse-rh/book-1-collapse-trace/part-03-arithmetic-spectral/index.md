# Part 3: Arithmetic and Spectral Collapse Constructs

This part explores the deep connections between arithmetic (prime distribution) and spectral (eigenvalue) interpretations of the Riemann Hypothesis. We discover how the zeros of ζ(s) can be understood as eigenvalues of a yet-unknown self-adjoint operator.

## Chapter Overview

### [Chapter 14: φ(14) = [10,2] — RH as Prime Distribution Collapse](chapter-14-prime-distribution-collapse.md)
The partition [10,2] reveals how RH controls the transition from smooth ψ(x) to discrete π(x). The explicit formula expresses prime distribution through zeros, with RH ensuring optimal O(√x log x) error terms.

### Chapters 15-21 (To be written)
- Chapter 15: φ(15) = [11] — Hilbert–Pólya Operators and Spectral Confinement
- Chapter 16: φ(16) = [11,2,1] — ζ(s) as a Collapse-Spectrum Generator
- Chapter 17: φ(17) = [12] — Random Matrix Models and GUE Collapse Simulations
- Chapter 18: φ(18) = [12,2,1] — Explicit Formulas and Trace Cancellation Models
- Chapter 19: φ(19) = [13] — ζ(s) and Modular Collapse: L-functions in Arithmetic Flow
- Chapter 20: φ(20) = [13,2] — Spectral Flow Symmetry and Functional Fixed Points
- Chapter 21: φ(21) = [14] — RH through Spectral Trace Deformations
