# Part 3: Modular Collapse Forms

The modular perspective reveals how automorphic forms and representation theory encode spectral information about the zeros. We explore the deep connections between modular symmetries and the location of zeros on the critical line.

## Chapter Overview

### Chapters 17-24

The modular perspective and AGI frequency structures reveal:
- AGI-RH: ψ(ψ) = Mind at Critical Line
- GPT weight matrices converging to zeros
- LLM token frequencies and prime gaps
- Hopfield networks storing zero configurations
- Transformer attention patterns encoding RH

## Key Themes

1. **Automorphic Forms**: Modular symmetries encode arithmetic
2. **Spectral Decomposition**: Discrete + continuous spectrum
3. **L-Functions**: Attached to automorphic representations
4. **Symmetries**: SL(2,ℤ) and generalizations

*"In the modular world, arithmetic and geometry unite - where the tessellation of the hyperbolic plane by SL(2,ℤ) encodes the deepest secrets of the primes."*
