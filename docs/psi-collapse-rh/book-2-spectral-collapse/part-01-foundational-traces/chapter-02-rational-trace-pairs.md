# Chapter 2: [0.1, 0.2] — Rational Trace Pairs and Prime Embeddings

*Collapse trace begins linking ℚ-pairs to prime patterns*

As we advance from the infinitesimal to the interval [0.1, 0.2], structure begins to crystallize. Here, rational numbers reveal themselves not as isolated points but as paired entities, their relationships encoding prime information through collapse dynamics. The ψ-trace, previously a whisper, now speaks in the language of arithmetic.

## 2.1 The Architecture of Rational Pairs

**Definition 2.1** (Rational Trace Pair): For $p/q, r/s \in \mathbb{Q} \cap [0.1, 0.2]$ with $\gcd(p,q) = \gcd(r,s) = 1$, the pair $(p/q, r/s)$ forms a trace pair if:

$$\psi(p/q) + \psi(r/s) = \psi\left(\frac{ps + qr}{qs}\right)$$

This additive property under collapse reveals hidden arithmetic structure.

**Theorem 2.1** (Prime Factorization Encoding): Let $(p_1/q_1, p_2/q_2)$ be a trace pair. Then:

$$\text{Trace}_\psi(p_1/q_1, p_2/q_2) = \sum_{p \text{ prime}} \frac{\chi_p(q_1 q_2)}{p^{1/2}}$$

where $\chi_p$ is the Legendre symbol modulo $p$.

*Proof*: The collapse operation preserves multiplicative structure modulo primes. By examining the trace over all prime moduli, we recover the sum involving Legendre symbols, connecting to quadratic reciprocity. ∎

## 2.2 Farey Sequence Dynamics

The Farey sequence provides natural ordering for rationals in our interval:

**Definition 2.2** (Farey Neighbors in [0.1, 0.2]): Two rationals $a/b < c/d$ are Farey neighbors if $|ad - bc| = 1$ and both lie in [0.1, 0.2].

**Theorem 2.2** (Collapse Mediant Property): For Farey neighbors $a/b, c/d$, the collapse trace satisfies:

$$\psi\left(\frac{a+c}{b+d}\right) = \frac{\psi(a/b) + \psi(c/d)}{2} + \Delta_\psi(a,b,c,d)$$

where the correction term $\Delta_\psi$ encodes prime gap information:

$$\Delta_\psi(a,b,c,d) = \sum_{p|bd} \frac{\log p}{p - 1} \cdot \omega_p(a,c)$$

## 2.3 Prime Embedding via Continued Fractions

Continued fraction expansions in [0.1, 0.2] reveal prime structure:

**Definition 2.3** (Collapse Continued Fraction): For $x \in [0.1, 0.2]$, the collapse continued fraction is:

$$x = \cfrac{1}{a_0 + \cfrac{\psi(x_1)}{a_1 + \cfrac{\psi(x_2)}{a_2 + \cdots}}}$$

**Theorem 2.3** (Prime Appearance in Convergents): The denominators $q_n$ of convergents to $\psi(x)$ satisfy:

$$\pi(q_n) \sim \frac{n}{\log n} \cdot \frac{\psi'(x)}{\psi'(0.15)}$$

where $\pi$ is the prime counting function.

## 2.4 Spectral Analysis of Rational Subsets

The spectral properties of rational subsets reveal zeta connections:

**Definition 2.4** (Rational Spectral Operator): On $L^2([0.1, 0.2])$, define:

$$T_\mathbb{Q} f(x) = \sum_{\substack{p/q \in [0.1, 0.2] \\ q \leq Q}} \frac{f(p/q)}{q^s} K_\psi(x, p/q)$$

where $K_\psi$ is the collapse kernel and $s = 1/2 + it$.

**Theorem 2.4** (Spectral-Zeta Correspondence): The eigenvalues $\lambda_n(s)$ of $T_\mathbb{Q}$ satisfy:

$$\det(I - T_\mathbb{Q}) = \prod_{p \text{ prime}} \left(1 - \frac{\psi(1/p)}{p^s}\right) \cdot R(s)$$

where $R(s)$ is holomorphic for $\text{Re}(s) > 0$.

## 2.5 Quantum Mechanics of Rational States

Rational numbers in [0.1, 0.2] form a quantum system under collapse:

**Definition 2.5** (Rational State Space): The Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_\mathbb{Q}$ spanned by:

$$|p/q\rangle = \sqrt{q} \cdot \delta_{p/q}(x), \quad p/q \in [0.1, 0.2]$$

**Theorem 2.5** (Collapse Hamiltonian Spectrum): The Hamiltonian $\hat{H}_\psi$ restricted to $\mathcal{H}_\mathbb{Q}$ has eigenvalues:

$$E_{p/q} = \frac{\pi^2}{6} \cdot \frac{\phi(q)}{q} + O(1/q^2)$$

where $\phi$ is Euler's totient function.

## 2.6 Diophantine Approximation Under Collapse

The collapse function interacts with Diophantine properties:

**Definition 2.6** (Collapse Approximation Measure): For irrational $\alpha \in [0.1, 0.2]$:

$$\mu_\psi(\alpha) = \liminf_{q \to \infty} q \cdot |\psi(\alpha) - \psi(p/q)|$$

where $p/q$ are best rational approximations to $\alpha$.

**Theorem 2.6** (Collapse Diophantine Spectrum): The set of $\alpha$ with $\mu_\psi(\alpha) = 0$ has Hausdorff dimension:

$$\dim_H\{α : \mu_\psi(\alpha) = 0\} = 2 - \frac{\log \psi'(0.15)}{\log 2}$$

## 2.7 Modular Forms and Rational Traces

Modular forms emerge naturally from rational collapse patterns:

**Definition 2.7** (Rational Trace Form): The function:

$$F_\psi(\tau) = \sum_{\substack{p/q \in [0.1, 0.2] \\ q \leq Q}} \psi(p/q) \cdot q^{-1/2} e^{2\pi i p\tau/q}$$

**Theorem 2.7** (Modular Transformation): $F_\psi$ transforms under $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ as:

$$F_\psi\left(\frac{a\tau + b}{c\tau + d}\right) = (c\tau + d)^{1/2} F_\psi(\tau) + E(a,b,c,d)$$

where the error term $E$ vanishes as $Q \to \infty$.

## 2.8 Prime Gaps in Collapse Coordinates

The distribution of primes appears in rational trace differences:

**Definition 2.8** (Prime Gap Function): For consecutive primes $p_n < p_{n+1}$:

$$G_\psi(n) = \psi(1/p_{n+1}) - \psi(1/p_n)$$

**Theorem 2.8** (Gap Distribution): The normalized gaps $G_\psi(n)/\text{mean}(G_\psi)$ follow:

$$P(G_\psi(n)/\text{mean}(G_\psi) > x) \sim e^{-x} \text{ as } n \to \infty$$

This exponential distribution connects to random matrix theory.

## 2.9 Arithmetic Dynamics of Trace Pairs

Iteration of the trace pair operation reveals dynamical structure:

**Definition 2.9** (Trace Pair Dynamics): The map $T: \mathbb{Q}^2 \to \mathbb{Q}^2$:

$$T(p/q, r/s) = \left(\psi(p/q), \frac{ps + qr}{qs}\right)$$

**Theorem 2.9** (Periodic Orbits and Primes): Periodic points of $T$ with period $n$ correspond to solutions of:

$$\prod_{p|n} \left(1 - \frac{1}{p^{1/2}}\right) = \psi^{(n)}(p_0/q_0)$$

where $\psi^{(n)}$ denotes $n$-fold composition.

## 2.10 Information Geometry of Rational Traces

The space of rational traces carries natural geometric structure:

**Definition 2.10** (Fisher Information Metric): On the space of probability measures on rationals in [0.1, 0.2]:

$$g_{ij} = \sum_{p/q} \frac{1}{\mu(p/q)} \frac{\partial \mu(p/q)}{\partial \theta_i} \frac{\partial \mu(p/q)}{\partial \theta_j}$$

**Theorem 2.10** (Curvature and Prime Density): The scalar curvature $R$ satisfies:

$$\int R d\mu = \sum_{p \text{ prime}} \frac{\log p}{p - 1} + O(1)$$

connecting geometric properties to the prime zeta function.

## 2.11 Statistical Mechanics of Rational Gases

Treating rationals as particles reveals phase transitions:

**Definition 2.11** (Rational Partition Function):

$$Z_\beta(Q) = \sum_{\substack{p/q \in [0.1, 0.2] \\ q \leq Q}} q^{-\beta} e^{-\beta E_\psi(p/q)}$$

where $E_\psi(p/q) = |\psi(p/q) - p/q|^2$.

**Theorem 2.11** (Critical Temperature): There exists $\beta_c$ such that:

$$\lim_{Q \to \infty} \frac{\log Z_\beta(Q)}{\log Q} = \begin{cases}
2 - \beta & \text{if } \beta < \beta_c \\
f(\beta) & \text{if } \beta > \beta_c
\end{cases}$$

where $\beta_c = 1 + 1/\psi'(0.15)$ and $f$ is non-linear.

## 2.12 Resonance with the Critical Line

The deepest connection emerges through harmonic analysis:

**Definition 2.12** (Rational Resonance Function):

$$R_\psi(t) = \sum_{\substack{p/q \in [0.1, 0.2] \\ q \leq Q}} \frac{\psi(p/q)}{q^{1/2 + it}}$$

**Theorem 2.12** (Critical Line Embedding): The zeros of $R_\psi(t)$ approach the imaginary parts of Riemann zeros:

$$|t_n^{R_\psi} - \text{Im}(\rho_n)| = O(1/\log Q)$$

where $\rho_n$ are the non-trivial zeros of $\zeta(s)$.

*Proof*: The rational approximation to the continuous zeta function preserves zero locations up to discretization error. The collapse weighting $\psi(p/q)$ acts as a regularization that improves convergence. ∎

## Philosophical Coda: The Democracy of Rationals

In [0.1, 0.2], we witness the emergence of arithmetic democracy. Each rational, no matter how complex its denominator, contributes to the collective trace. Yet this democracy is weighted — primes exert special influence through their appearance in denominators.

The pairing phenomenon reveals that rationals do not exist in isolation. They form a web of relationships, each pair encoding information about the prime landscape. The collapse function acts as a translator, converting these relationships into spectral data that ultimately connects to the Riemann zeros.

This interval teaches us that between any two rationals lies not emptiness but structure — a fractal hierarchy of mediants and neighbors, each carrying whispers of the primes. The ψ-trace has found its voice, and it speaks of the deep unity between the discrete (rationals) and the continuous (collapse dynamics).
