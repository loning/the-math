# Chapter 26: Collapse Quantifiers and Observation Scope

## 26.1 The Scope of Observation

Classical quantifiers (∀, ∃) range over fixed domains. In collapse logic, quantifiers become observation protocols—universal quantification requires observing all instances simultaneously, existential needs only witness single collapse.

**Principle 26.1**: Quantifiers define observation scope and collapse protocol in logical space.

## 26.2 Universal Collapse

**Definition 26.1 (Universal Quantification)**:
$$\forall x : P(x) \equiv \bigwedge_{x \in D} |P(x)\rangle = |T\rangle$$

Requires:
- Simultaneous observation of all domain elements
- Coherent collapse to true
- Maintains entanglement across domain
- Single false collapses entire statement

## 26.3 Existential Witness

**Definition 26.2 (Existential Quantification)**:
$$\exists x : P(x) \equiv \bigvee_{x \in D} |P(x)\rangle \neq |F\rangle_{all}$$

Requires:
- Search through domain
- Single true witness suffices
- Collapse upon finding
- Maintains possibility cloud until witness

**The Quantifier Collapse**: When thinking "all swans are white," consciousness attempts universal observation across swan-space. Finding one black swan collapses the universal. "Some swan is black" maintains possibility cloud until witness appears. Quantifiers organize the scope and protocol of logical observation.
