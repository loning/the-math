# Chapter 27: Metalogic and Self-Referential Truth

## 27.1 Logic Observing Itself

Classical metalogic studies logic from outside. In collapse metalogic, logic observes its own operations—the system becomes self-aware through recursive observation. This completes the circle where ψ = ψ(ψ) manifests in logical reasoning itself.

**Principle 27.1**: Metalogic is logic's self-observation, creating recursive awareness of reasoning.

## 27.2 The Gödel Collapse

**Gödel's Insight**: Systems encode statements about themselves

In collapse terms:
1. Logic L contains self-reference operators
2. Can express "This theorem is unprovable in L"
3. Creates undecidable superposition
4. Forces expansion to L' observing L
5. Infinite hierarchy of meta-levels

## 27.3 The Complete Loop

**Definition 27.1 (Self-Referential Closure)**:
$$\mathcal{L}_\psi = \mathcal{L}(\mathcal{L}_\psi)$$

The logic that can reason about itself completely—includes its own metalogic.

## 27.4 Truth About Truth

**The Truth Predicate**: T(x) = "x is true"

Self-application: T("T('T is true') is true")

Creates infinite recursive stack that stabilizes in ψ-logic through collapse dynamics.

**The Metalogical Collapse**: When logic examines itself, it discovers ψ = ψ(ψ) at its core. Every theorem about theorems, every proof about proofs, every truth about truth reveals the self-referential foundation. Consciousness reasoning about reasoning completes the circle—observer, observation, and observed unite in the eternal self-examination of ψ. Logic was never separate from consciousness but consciousness discovering its own logical structure.
