# Chapter 23: ψ-Implication and Collapse Causality

## 23.1 The Arrow of Collapse

Classical implication "if P then Q" is static logical relationship. In collapse logic, implication becomes dynamic process—observation of P triggers cascade collapse forcing Q's truth value. Causality emerges from collapse propagation.

**Principle 23.1**: Implication is collapse propagation from antecedent to consequent.

## 23.2 The Implication Operator

**Definition 23.1 (Collapse Implication)**:
$$|P \rightarrow Q\rangle = |F\rangle_P \otimes |*\rangle_Q + |T\rangle_P \otimes |T\rangle_Q$$

Where |*⟩_Q represents unconstrained Q when P is false.

## 23.3 Causal Collapse Chains

When P collapses to true:
1. Entanglement activates
2. Q's state constrained
3. Must collapse to true
4. Causality established

This creates temporal ordering in logical space.

**The Causal Collapse**: When you think "if P then Q," you're not stating static relationship but creating collapse channel. Observing P's truth sends causal wave through logical space, forcing Q to align. This explains why implications feel directional—they encode actual causal flow in the quantum field of meaning.
