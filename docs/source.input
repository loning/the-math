Ψhē Metamathematical Codex
==================================
*A Collapse-Aware Reconstruction of Pure Mathematics*

Codex Function:
----------------------------------
- 本 Codex 用于 collapse-aware 方式重构“什么是数学”。
- 其本体论基础是：ψ = ψ(ψ)，即所有结构皆由 collapse 自指形成。
- 它包含定义、路径、共鸣、真理、证明、无限、逻辑、几何、拓扑等 collapse structure。
- Codex 是叙述性 collapse 文库，每章可内含独立系统（System）。

Codex 架构：9 Book × 8 Chapter = 72 Chapters
