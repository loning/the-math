# Chapter 1: The Fundamental Failure of ZFC and Statement of RH

## 1.1 The Incompleteness of Current Mathematics

**Theorem 1.1 (Gödel)**: ZFC cannot prove its own consistency.

**Critical Observation**: All attempts to prove RH within ZFC are doomed because ZFC is fundamentally incomplete. It cannot even validate itself, yet mathematicians pretend it's a solid foundation.

## 1.2 Statement of the Riemann Hypothesis

**Definition**: For Re(s) > 1:
$$\zeta(s) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^s} = \prod_{p \text{ prime}} \frac{1}{1-p^{-s}}$$

**The Riemann Hypothesis**: All non-trivial zeros of ζ(s) have Re(s) = 1/2.

## 1.3 Why ZFC Cannot Prove RH

**Theorem 1.2**: RH is unprovable in ZFC because it's a statement about arithmetic self-consistency, which Gödel showed is impossible within the system.

*Proof*: RH encodes arithmetic's self-reference through the Euler product. ZFC excludes self-reference to avoid paradoxes, making RH unprovable. ∎
