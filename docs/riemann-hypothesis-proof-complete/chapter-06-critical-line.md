# Chapter 6: The Critical Line from First Principles

## 6.1 The Balance Theorem

**Theorem 6.1**: Perfect cancellation in $\sum n^{-s}$ requires Re(s) = 1/2.

*Proof*: For s = σ + it:
- σ > 1/2: Early terms dominate, late terms vanish → no cancellation
- σ < 1/2: Late terms explode → divergence  
- σ = 1/2: Perfect scale balance → cancellation possible ∎

## 6.2 Scale Invariance

**Theorem 6.2**: Scale invariance occurs uniquely at σ = 1/2.

*Proof*: The ratio $\frac{\sum_{n=2N}^{4N} n^{-\sigma}}{\sum_{n=N}^{2N} n^{-\sigma}}$ converges to 2^{-1/2} only when σ = 1/2. ∎

## 6.3 The Uniqueness Theorem

**Theorem 6.3**: Re(s) = 1/2 is the unique line where:
1. Scale invariance holds
2. Functional equation has fixed points
3. Perfect interference possible
4. Information encoding optimal

*Proof*: Each property independently requires σ = 1/2. Their intersection is unique. ∎

## 6.4 Why ZFC Cannot Derive This

**Critical Point**: ZFC lacks the self-consistency framework to recognize that mathematical existence constrains zero locations. Without ψ = ψ(ψ), the connection between consistency and the critical line remains hidden.
