# Chapter 5: The Zeta Function as Arithmetic Mirror

## 5.1 Dual Representations

**The Two Forms**:
$$\zeta(s) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^s} = \prod_{p \text{ prime}} \frac{1}{1-p^{-s}}$$

**Theorem 5.1**: This duality is arithmetic observing itself.

*Proof*: Sum = counting, Product = factoring. Their equality means arithmetic is self-consistent. ∎

## 5.2 The Functional Equation

**Theorem 5.2**: $\xi(s) = \xi(1-s)$ forces zeros to Re(s) = 1/2.

*Proof*: The transformation s ↦ 1-s has fixed points only at Re(s) = 1/2. Zeros must respect this symmetry or arithmetic becomes inconsistent. ∎

## 5.3 Information Constraints

**Theorem 5.3**: Zeros must form a 1D set.

*Proof*: ζ(s) is determined by 1D boundary data. Cannot encode 2D zero distribution. By symmetry, the 1D set is Re(s) = 1/2. ∎

## 5.4 The Critical Line Necessity

**Theorem 5.4**: Off-line zeros create arithmetic paradoxes.

*Proof*: If ρ has Re(ρ) ≠ 1/2, then:
- 1-ρ also a zero with different real part
- Explicit formula has incompatible growth rates
- Prime distribution becomes contradictory
- Arithmetic collapses ∎
