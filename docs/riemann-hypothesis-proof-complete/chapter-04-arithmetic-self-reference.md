# Chapter 4: Arithmetic as a Self-Referential System

## 4.1 The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic

**Theorem 4.1 (Fundamental Theorem)**: Every n > 1 has unique prime factorization.

**Critical Insight**: This theorem reveals arithmetic's inherent self-reference—numbers defined by other numbers.

## 4.2 Self-Reference vs ZFC's Failures

**ZFC's Circular Disaster**:
- Natural numbers defined using... natural numbers (successor function)
- Peano axioms assume what they claim to define
- Induction principle requires the very structure it establishes

**Our Framework**: Self-reference is explicit via ψ = ψ(ψ).

## 4.3 Key Theorems

**Theorem 4.2**: Unique factorization ⟺ arithmetic self-consistency.

*Proof*: Non-unique factorization → contradictory divisibility → inconsistent arithmetic. ∎

**Theorem 4.3**: The Euler product encodes arithmetic self-reference:
$$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^s} = \prod_{p} \frac{1}{1-p^{-s}}$$

*Proof*: Left = additive view, Right = multiplicative view. Their equality IS arithmetic recognizing itself. ∎

**Theorem 4.4**: Zeros of ζ(s) are points where arithmetic's self-recognition achieves perfect balance.

*Proof*: At zeros, all arithmetic aspects cancel perfectly—the ultimate self-referential statement. ∎
